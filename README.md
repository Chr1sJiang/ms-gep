# ms-gep: GEP based on multi-strategy
This is a library that implements ms-gep
It is Python3.8.

## Rationale of the chromosomes
The chromosome parameters are:
- `head_length`: How long are the heads of the genes
- `gene_number`: How many genes there should be
- `functions`: Which functions are used to generate the tree
- `terminals`: Which terminals are used in the tree
- `random_dc`: If to add random domain and autogenerated constants
- `random_num`: How many random constants to have per gene
- `adf_length`: How long are the heads of the adf section
- `adf_functions`: Which functions to use in the adf section
- `adf_num`: How many adf to have per chromosome
- `link_function`: Which function to use for linking

### Running instructions
step1: dataset settings
  function_mining.py DataPoint.class
step2: ms-gep parameters settings
  function_mining.py main.class
step3: run and save model
